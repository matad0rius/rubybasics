# Definition

# Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that 
# uses objects and their interactions to design and program applications

# - Allows the program to block off areas of code that perform certain tasks 
# independently of other areas in the application.

# Encapsulation - concept of blocking off areas of code
#  and not making it available to the rest of the program

# Abstraction - is simplifying a complex process of a program, an enterprise software solution 
# for example by modeling classes appropriate for it

# Inheritance - is used where a class inherits the behavior of another class, 
# referred to as the superclass

# Polymorphism - is when a class inherits the behaviors of another class, 
# but has the ability to not inherit everything and change some of itâ€™s inherited behaviors. 
# For example to write a method that does something differently from the inherited method

# Classes - It is a blueprint that describes the state and behavior that the objects of the class all share. 
# A class can be used to create many objects. Objects created at runtime from a class are called instances of that particular class.

# Example of a user class

class Student
    attr_accessor :first_name, :last_name, :email, :password # be able to acces
    # attr_reader :username # only be able to read

    def initialize(firstname, lastname, username, email, password)
        @first_name = firstname
        @last_name = lastname
        @username = username
        @email = email
        @password = password
    end

    def to_s
        "First name: #{@first_name}, Last name #{@last_name}"
    end

end

mata = Student.new("mata", "mistek", "matadorius", "mata@gmail.com", "12345") # creating an object
aldamir = Student.new("aldamir", "matrix", "alvaro", "alvaro@gmail.com", "54321") 
# puts mata # default print to_s method when we print a class
mata.last_name = aldamir.last_name
puts "mata is altered"
puts mata
